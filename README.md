# 2021-Canadian-election-NLP-Sentiment-Analysis

The purpose of this project is to compute the sentiment of text information - in our case, tweets posted recently on Canadian Elections - and answer the research question: “What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the Canadian political landscape in 2021?” The goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insights into the Canadian Elections. 

There are two sets of data are used for this project. The sentiment_analysis.csv file contains tweets that have had their sentiments already analyzed and recorded as binary values 0 (negative) and 1 (positive). Each line is a single tweet, which may contain multiple sentences despite their brevity. The second data set, Canadian_elections_2021.csv contains a list of tweets regarding the 2021 Canadian federal elections.

Logistic regression, k-NN, Naive Bayes, SVM, decision trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, along with deep learning models are used in this project.
